## 👋 Hi, I’m Sofia Caperna
I am a Senior Software Engineer. I have a background in theoretical Mathematics and theoretical Computer Science (think Algorithms, Lambda Calculus, ML).
I have a keen interest in designing, building, and deploying applications, especially when it involves building ML or mathsy models.

Outside of work, I enjoy all things sports and nature related! I particularly enjoy:

- ❄️ Skiing and Ice skating
- 🤸 Yoga and Calisthenics
- ✈️ Travelling to new places and learning new languages! (currently working on my German).
